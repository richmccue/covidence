# Covidence, and Introduction

- Pre-workshop activities: 5 min 
- Introductory presentation: 12 min

## Why Covidence? 

[Covidence](https://www.covidence.org/){:target="_blank"} is a web-based platform that streamlines the process of conducting comprehensive literature reviews, including systematic reviews, scoping reviews, meta-syntheses, and meta-narratives.

Covidence is ideal for team collaboration and allows multiple reviewers to work on a project simultaneously; however, it can also be used individually. Covidence bundles citation screening, full-text review, risk of bias assessment, and the exportation of data and references together onto one platform saving researchers valuable time and improving the quality of evidence synthesis.

1. Explain that Covidence bundles duplication detection, reference screening, and full text review into a single web-based platform
